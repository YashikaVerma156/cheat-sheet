##############Git push existing repo(A) to a new and different remote repo(B)######################
1. Create a new repo(B) at github.
2. Clone the repo(A) to your local machine.
3. git remote rename origin upstream
4. git remote add origin URL_TO_REPO_B
5. git push origin master
Now you can work with it just like any other github repo. To pull in patches from upstream, 
simply run git pull upstream master && git push origin master.
